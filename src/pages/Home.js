                Welcome to my Website!

                I’m junior at Santa Clara University School of Engineering studying Computer Science and Engineering.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                When I'm not programming I enjoy coaching, practicing, and watching combat sports. 
                Helping coach my high school’s wrestling team has been a humbling experience and inspired me to continue with my own grappling training. 
                I've been learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and more recently, Judo. I also love to watch the UFC events and try my best to keep up with college wrestling. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I am looking for an internship in software engineering, robotics, or machine learning for summer 2024. 
                If you have a position opening or would like to talk, you can reach me at isaacorais2002@gmail.com.
